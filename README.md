ML Deployment and Portfolio Optimization

Here I attempt to diversify find an investment alternative investment portfolio of peer-to-peer loans. Since this asset class is potentially
uncorrelated with other asset classes and offers high returns advertised by these platforms, it seems to be an attractive value
proposition, especially excited by the large amount of data these platforms make publicly available. 

I attempt to model the probability of default utilizing multiple standard ML algorithms and apply a ranking of risk to each loan based on differing
strategies ultimately identifying the best loans to invest in that produce the optimal risk / return portfolio.
